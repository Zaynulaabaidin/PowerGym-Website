# PowerGym-Website
This is Static Website, in which we use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is our final year project in the Diploma in Information Technology, we developed a static website with seven main pages: 
- [Home](#Home)
- [About Us](#AboutUs)
- [Courses](#Courses)
- [Gallery](#Gallery)
- [Course Details](#CourseDetails)
- [Course Schedule](#CourseSchedule)
- [Contact Us](#ContactUs)

The project involved designing and building a user-friendly interface focused on delivering specific content effectively and efficiently. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, we ensured the site was responsive and accessible on various devices. Bootstrap helped streamline the development of interactive elements, clean navigation, and optimized loading times. This project allowed us to apply web development principles, enhance our coding skills, and gain hands-on experience with front-end development.
